# Simple MRPT scene rendered on a Qt backend

To run the source code please use the cmake tool inside the folder to create the Makefile. And then simply use the Makefile to compile the code.

This code uses the mrpt::opengl::COpenGLScene class to create a simple scene and then render it on a QOpenGLWidget class. 

## Controls

###  Keyboard

Use the right and left arrow key to change the azimuth angle and use the up and down arrow key to change the elevation angle..

### Mouse

Use the mouse scroll to zoom in and zoom out and use the right click drag to change the elevation angle and use the left click drag to change the azimuth angle.

## Screenshots

This is how the scene will look like once it renders.
